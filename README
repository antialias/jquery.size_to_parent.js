Use size_to_parent to set the font size of a child element so that the width of the child element matches the parent element as closely as possible.

Usage:

$(".sometext").size_to_fit_parent({min_fs:10, max_fs:80, debug:true, max_enlarge_scale:10});

Options:

min_fs:
	defaults to 3
	The font size (in pixels) will never be set above this value

max_fs:
	defaults to 50
	The font size (in pixels) will never be set below this value
	
max_enlarge_scale:
	defaults to 10
	If the parent element is larger than the child element, the font size will not be greater than max_enlarge_scale * the current font size.

el_tol:
	defaults to 0.009
	This tolerance will be used when comparing the parent element's size to the child element's size to prevent an infinite loop
	Higher values may lead to greater deviation between the final chile width and the final parent width.
	
converge_tol:
	defaults to 0.00001
	This tolerance will be used in the binary search algorithm for comparing min font size and max font size.
	Higher values may lead to greater deviation between the final chile width and the final parent width.
	
white_space:
	defaults to "nowrap"
	The child element's 'white-space' css property is set to this. Values other than "nowrap" are untested.
	
debug:
	defaults to false
	Set to 1 or true to see debugging messages in the console. If using Firefox, requires firebug. Will break when used in Internet Explorer.
